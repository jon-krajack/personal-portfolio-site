## üõ†Ô∏è Project Roadmap: Building the Jeckal Web App

This is a sequence of 7 standalone but interconnected projects. Each one builds foundational skills for constructing **Jeckal**, a video-based language learning platform.

### Phase 1: Learning & Prototyping (Foundational Skills)

1. **Personal Portfolio Website + Interactive FAQ**  
   _Static responsive site with JavaScript interactivity, custom FAQ, and dark mode toggle._

2. **Video Library (Frontend Only)**  
   _A searchable, filterable video gallery using mock data to simulate Jeckal‚Äôs video content experience._

3. **Gated Video Access + Outseta Integration**  
   _User login/logout, subscription handling, and conditional rendering of premium video content using Outseta._

4. **Watched Progress Tracking (Frontend MVP)**  
   _Users can mark videos as watched, and toggle visibility using localStorage._

5. **Admin Upload Tool (CMS-lite)**  
   _Simple internal tool for adding/editing video metadata manually with form-based inputs._

---

### Phase 2: Jeckal Official Build (Live Production)

6. **Jeckal React Rebuild**  
   _Rebuild of the entire frontend using React, state management, reusable components, and Outseta integration._

7. **Backend API + Persistent Progress Tracking**  
   _Custom backend with Node.js and Express.js to persist user progress, supporting cross-device syncing and REST API routes._
